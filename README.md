## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Download and install the latest version of Git on your system. See https://git-scm.com/downloads.
	-	To make sure if your Git is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `git -v`.
-	Download and install the latest version of NodeJS and npm on your system. See https://nodejs.org/en/.
	-	npm is included with the NodeJS installation. This means that you only have to download and run the NodeJS installer.
	-	To make sure if your NodeJS is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `node -v`.
	-	To make sure if your npm is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `npm -v`.

If you prefer the command line way of downloading and installing things, then feel free to do so. Otherwise, the instructions above should get you up and running.

### How to run

-   Clone the repository for this project by running the following command in a terminal: 'git clone https://github.com/lugenx/ecohabit.git'.
