## Project Description

EcoHabit is a web app project that aims to create awareness of the environment and help people build environmental friendly habits.

It will visualize users' habits by tracking their activities (recycling, commuting, eating, etc.) and encourage them to improve their habits with better alternative options.

It also targets to be users' go-to place to find the closest recycling locations and give them clear instructions about how to divide and recycle each material.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/) (JavaScript)
*   **Backend:** [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs)/[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) (JavaScript)
*   **Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of Git on your system. See https://git-scm.com/downloads.
  - To make sure if your Git is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `git -v`.
- Download and install the latest version of NodeJS and npm on your system. See https://nodejs.org/en/.
  - npm is included with the NodeJS installation. This means that you only have to download and run the NodeJS installer.
  - To make sure if your NodeJS is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `node -v`.
  - To make sure if your npm is on the latest version, run this command on the command line: `npm -v`.

If you prefer the command line way of downloading and installing things, then feel free to do so. Otherwise, the instructions above should get you up and running.

### How to Run

- Clone the repository for this project by running the following command in a terminal: 
  ##### `git clone https://github.com/lugenx/ecohabit.git`
- Open the cloned folder in VS Code. Open the terminal and make sure its pointing to the root of the cloned project.


- Create Database for development use:

  - Create a mongodb account through the [MongoDB Website](https://www.mongodb.com)
  - Create a cluster (by default is Cluster0 which can be used)
  - Once the cluster is up, you need to click on the 'Connect' tab
  - Follow the drivers section to retrieve the mongodb connection url and save it for the next steps
  - Connection url - mongodb+srv://(username):(password)@cluster0.xqzlrqf.mongodb.net/(databasename)?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  - Replace the username and password you used for the mongo db account and put a databasename (eg. ecohabit)


- Run the backend NodeJS application:

  - Change the directory to server folder using terminal command: `cd server`
  - At the root of the server directory, create an .env file and copy the content from .env.example into the new .env file. 
  - Update the 'MONGODB_URL' property in the .env file with the mongodb connection url saved
  - In the server directory, you can run:

  ##### `npm install`

  - It'll download all the packages/dependencies as defined in package.json file. Once the system completes this process, we can type below command:

  ##### `npm start`

  - Runs the app in the development mode.
  - You can start making http calls to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

- Running Frontend React JS Application:

  - Change the directory to client folder using terminal command: `cd client`
  - In the client directory, you can run:

  ##### `npm install`

  - It'll download all the packages/dependencies as defined in package.json file. Once the system completes this process, we can type below command:

  ##### `npm start`

  - Runs the app in the development mode.
  - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

  - The page will reload if you make edits.
  - You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- Insert habit dummy data:

  - Go back to the MongoDB website to your project.
  - The collection with the databasename you provided will be present (created when you started the server app)
  - Inside the collection, you will find 'habits' as a subcollection
  - Open it and you can insert the below dummy documents

```
  {
    "category": "Recycle",
    "description": "Reduce the amount of waste by using reusable bags!",
    "question": "Which one of these did you use today?",
    "answerOptions": ["Reusable bag", "Plastic bag", "Both", "None"]
  }
```

```
  {
    "category": "Commute",
    "description": "Carpool with coworker or friends",
    "question": "How did you commute to work today?",
    "answerOptions": ["Drived", "Carpooled", "Bike", "Public Transport"]
  }
```

```
  {
    "category": "Recycle",
    "description": "Separate your recycble materials",
    "question": "Did you separate your recycble materials today?",
    "answerOptions": ["Yes", "No"]
  }
```
- Note: When you insert a document, append the above json fields to the already defined unique id in the document

- The link [MongoDB Insert Document](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/insert-documents/)
 shows how to insert the document in the mongodb manually through the UI


  - The page will reload if you make edits.
  - You will also see any lint errors in the console.
